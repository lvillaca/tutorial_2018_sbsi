#java opts - heap e stack
#Each Java virtual machine thread has a private Java virtual machine stack, created at the same time as the thread.
# A Java virtual machine stack stores frames.
# The Java virtual machine has a heap that is shared among all Java virtual machine threads.
# The heap is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.
# The heap is created on virtual machine start-up. Heap storage for objects is reclaimed by an automatic
# storage management system (known as a garbage collector); objects are never explicitly deallocated.
